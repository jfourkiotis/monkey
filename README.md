An interpreter implementation for the `Monkey` programming language in various languages.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains implementations for the `Monkey` programming language described in
the book *Writing an Interpreter in Go* by *Thorsten Ball*. The `Go` implementation is the 
reference implementation found in the book and it is being ported currently in `C++`, `Scala`.

#### Current status
* `Go`   : completed, macros are supported
* `Scala`: completed (support for dictionaries is not implemented, neither macros)
* `C++`  : mostly incomplete

### How do I get set up? ###

Have a look at the `README.md` files in each (language) folder.
